# Motivation

Javascript is one of the most popular programing languges today.

## Things you can do with JS

### 1) Websites

- Node.js and React are some of the most popular systems for both backend and frontend development and they are 100% Javascript.

### 2) Chatbots

- Chatbots are the next wave in marketing and interactive tech. Botpress is a framework for creating and managing chatbots using javascript. Plus, just about all the chatbot-as-a-service products use standard web protocols, which means javascript works perfectly.

### 3) Video games

- Javascript is being used to build entire game engines.
- Libraries like Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL. Website: <https://threejs.org>

### 4) Machine Learning

- Google’s Tensorflow is now in javascript. But it’s far from alone. There are a number of other great frameworks as well:
- BrainJS: for building Neural Nets
- Compromise: for natural language processing
- WebDNN: for running neural nets in the browser using graphics cards.
- Keras.js: which can run pre-trained Keras models using javascript.

The key takeaway is that javascript gives you access to Machine Learning and AI from server to browser. This makes it easy to hook into an existing backend or app, all using JS.

### 5) Robots and IoT

Javascript Even entered the world of Iot and connected machines. Here are some libraries to name a few:

-Johnny-Five: Johnny-five is probably the most popular Javascript robotics and IoT platform for Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison Tessel 2

- Cylon.js: Cylon is a Javascript framework with support for over 43 platforms for robotics, physical computing and internet of tgs.

- Node-Red: Node-Red was built with an idea of creating a simple, visual way to handle streams of data in the physical and digital worlds.

## Conclusion

There isn’t much left you can’t do with Javascript. If you are going to learn a new programming language or you are a new developer, this is the place to start.
