# Git

## Working tree

What we see in our file system where we add edit and files.

## History

Commit graph in the .git hidden file

## Staging Area (index)

Any changes in the stagning area can be put into a commit

## Note

The `git init` command creates the .git subdirectory (which holds our repo, it'll start maintaning history)
git tracks files that are in the staging area

## Fast forward merge

Merging the base branch with the child Branch

## Three way merge (commit merge)

It merges the last commit of the base branch and other branches

## conflits
